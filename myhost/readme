DESCRIPTION:
myhost is a four level priority dispatcher simulator operating on four priority levels. Each executing process is simulated by using a thread for each process, using queues of threads as priority queues. Myhost operates within the constraints of a finite amount of resources, consisting of: two printers, one scanner, one modem, two CD drives and 1024 Mbytes of memory. Myhost has four prioirty levels with 0 being the highest priority assigned to real time processes and 3 being the lowest, levels 1-3 are meant for normal user processes. Levels 1-3 are handled using a time sliced feedback scheduler using a time of one second as a basic time quantum. Level 0 processes preempt any running process and run right away to completion with a FCFS technique. Myhost takes an input file to be called input.txt as processes
to execute.

LANGUAGE:
C programming language with ANSI standard libraries supported.

SHELl:
Uses the bash shell.
